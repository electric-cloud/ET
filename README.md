# ET - RPM Pipeline

This Electric Flow Pipeline implements an RPM delivery pipeline. The pipeline is implemented as follows:
1. It builds two artifacts ([ET_comp1](https://github.com/electric-cloud/ET_comp1), [ET_comp2](https://github.com/electric-cloud/ET_comp2)) from github repos and publish them to the Electric Cloud artifact repository
1. It packages these artifacts as an RPM and publishes the RPM to an Apache server (https://<flowserverHostName/RPMs)
1. It deploys the RPM to Integration, Staging, and PRD enviroments (currenly all resources are the same CentOS machine)

## Dependencies
1. Flow Ubuntu or CentOS server.  In the case of Ubuntu, RPM packages must be installed.
1. CentOS agent
1. [EC-RPM](https://github.com/electric-cloud/EC-RPM) plugin installed and promoted on Flow server
1. [Unplug plugin](https://github.com/electric-cloud/Unplug) plugin installed and promoted on Flow server

## Installation
1. Install rpm on server, ```sudo apt-get install rpm```
1. Create a git configuration and set it in build.groovy and package.groovy
1. Edit the IP address for the CentOS target machine in deploy.groovy
1. Import the DSL ```./install.sh```
1. Copy the contents of Inventory.groovy to /server/unplug/vc, ```ectool setProperty "/server/unplug/vc" --valueFile Inventory.groovy```

## Optional
1. To enable directory listing to Apache file server, add the following lines to */opt/electriccloud/electriccommander/apache/conf/httpd.conf*:
```
<Directory /opt/electriccloud/electriccommander/apache/htdocs/RPMs>
  Options +Indexes
</Directory>
```
and restart Apache:
```sudo /etc/init.d/commanderApache restart```

## Instructions
1. Run the release
1. The Application can be run from snapshots created by the release pipeline
1. RPM Inventory and content can be viewed at https://<FlowHostName>/commander/pages/unplug/un_runc

## TODO
- Flow server URL lookup for RPM
